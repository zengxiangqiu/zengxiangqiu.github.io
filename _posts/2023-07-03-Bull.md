[Auto-discover queues](https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board/issues/573)

> There is no a way to auto-discover queues, because you need to provide the connection & the specific connection....
You can add queues dynamically, with addQueue method that createBullBoard returns.

[Deadly0](https://github.com/Deadly0/bull-board-docker/blob/master/src/index.js#L44)

```js
const {setQueues} = createBullBoard({queues: [], serverAdapter});

client.KEYS(`${config.BULL_PREFIX}:*`, (err, keys) => {...

setQueues(queueList);
```
