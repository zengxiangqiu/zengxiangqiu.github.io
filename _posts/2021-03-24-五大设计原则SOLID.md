## 1. 单一职能原则 Single Responsibility SRP
 a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change

## 2. 开放关闭原则 Open for Extension, Closed for Modification  OCP
classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs

Of course, the one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.

## 3. 里氏替换原则 Liskov Substitution LSP

if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.

## 4. 接口隔离原则 Interface Segregation ISP

larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.

## 5. 依赖倒置原则 Dependency Inversion DIP

The principle of Dependency Inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
