## 关于daemon
As explained above, a daemon is a non-interactive program. It runs all the time, and it’s not connected to the terminal. Even when you close the terminal, the operating system will not stop the daemon as it will run in the background.

On the other hand, a process will stop when the terminal closes because it is an executing program instance.
