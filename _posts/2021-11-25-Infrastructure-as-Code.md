## IaC
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning of infrastructure, enabling your organization to develop, deploy, and scale cloud applications with greater speed, less risk, and reduced cost.

> When you have identified everything you need, remember:
  **Use version control**; everything should be tracked using version control.
  **Code everything**; nothing should be done manually. Use code to describe the desired state.
  Idempotence. Every result from the code you write should always yield the same result, no matter how many times it is executed.
  **Make your code modular**.
  **Test**, test, test
  Again: Use version control. Don't ever forget this.
